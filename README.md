README Generator

**Description**

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

In the file, typing node index.js in the terminal prompts a series of questions to fill out the README. 

**User Story**

I want a quick way to generate a README.md file with a title, description, directions on how to use, contributions, licensing, and addtional contact info

**Project Status**

The project is working. I am unsure if it needs additional styling in the future as README.md files are dry to start with.
